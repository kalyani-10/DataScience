# Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform with Smart Contracts

## Project Overview

Welcome to our decentralized crowdfunding platform, powered by smart contracts! This repository contains the codebase for our final year project, where we've designed a cutting-edge crowdfunding platform leveraging blockchain technology.

### Database Requirements

Our project relies on MongoDB Cloud Atlas to store blockchain hyperledgers database. This choice was made to ensure a robust and scalable database solution, accommodating the complexities of blockchain data storage.

### Software Requirements

To run and interact with our platform, ensure you have the following software components installed:

- **NodeJS**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
- **Ethereum**: The blockchain platform supporting our smart contracts.
- **Infura API**: A service that provides access to the Ethereum network without the need to run a node.
- **Flutter**: The UI toolkit used for developing cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework used for testing our smart contracts.
- **Gpay API**: Integrated for handling transactions, with only transaction details stored in smart contracts.

### Project Significance

This repository encapsulates the culmination of our final year project, where I took charge of managing backend databases and grappled with significant data volumes.Recognizing cryptocurrency volatility, we incorporated gPay into the platform, storing only transaction details in 
smart contracts. This experience immersed me in data management intricacies, sparking a deeper interest in data science. 

The decision to incorporate MongoDB Cloud Atlas and leverage the power of Ethereum blockchain with smart contracts reflects our commitment to creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized crowdfunding experience.

The journey through this project has provided invaluable insights into data management intricacies, sparking a deeper interest in data science.
